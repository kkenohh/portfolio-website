- **Dec. 21, 2024:** Project created. Started work on it. I got to 21:38 in the tutorial so I'm working on the navbar. I still need to get used to Tailwind and also need refreshers on some of the JS functions like Array.map.
- **Dec. 22, 2024:** Working on animations and transitions today. Some things I learned is that it's better to keep everything centered so that it collapses on smaller screens. Also, I need to take a deeper look into framer-motion, the variables that are being used in motion.div, setting up tailwind.config.mjs, and basically the whole Stairs component.
- **Dec. 22, 2024:** Part 2. I ended up finishing the mobile nav and creating part of the homepage. I will need to change some of the buttons because I don't have some socials. Not much I want to put down, but maybe in the future, I can change the nav links to buttons so that I can press the space around it instead of precisely clicking the link. Ended at 1:01:52.
- **Dec. 25, 2024:** I worked on the profile photo and animation today, but I don't have a circular photo. I could make one, but I want to get comfortable with framer, so I'm trying to make a rectangular animation instead of a circular one in the video. The problem I'm facing is that the left and top sides of the animation get cut off. Like it can't be outside of the photo. It must have something to do with the layers of the SVG and Image, but I'm not really sure what. I will try to fix it next time. I stopped at 1:13:06.
- **Dec. 26, 2024:** Finished home page and worked on services page. I still need to customize it to my information, but I will do that later. I might try to change the sections on the services page to allow you to click anywhere to go to the link. Ended at 1:32:54.
