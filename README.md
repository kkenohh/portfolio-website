- Dec. 21, 2024: Project created. Started work on it. I got to 21:38 in the tutorial so I'm working on the navbar. I still need to get used to Tailwind and also need refreshers on some of the JS functions like Array.map.

- Dec. 22, 2024: Working on animations and transitions today. Some things I learned is that it's better to keep everything centered so that it collapses on smaller screens. Also, I need to take a deeper look into framer-motion, the variables that are being used in motiond.div, setting up tailwind.config.mjs, and basically the whole Stairs component.

- Dec. 22, 2024: Part 2. I ended up finishing the mobile nav and creating part of the homepage. I will need to change some of the buttons because I don't have some socials. Not much I want to put down, but maybe in the future, I can change the nav links to buttons so that I can press the space around it instead of precisely clicking the link. Ended at 1:01:52.
