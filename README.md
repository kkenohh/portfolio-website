- Dec. 21, 2024: Project created. Started work on it. I got to 21:38 in the tutorial so I'm working on the navbar. I still need to get used to Tailwind and also need refreshers on some of the JS functions like Array.map.

- Dec. 22, 2024: Working on animations and transitions today. Some things I learned is that it's better to keep everything centered so that it collapses on smaller screens. Also, I need to take a deeper look into framer-motion, the variables that are being used in motiond.div, setting up tailwind.config.mjs, and basically the whole Stairs component.
